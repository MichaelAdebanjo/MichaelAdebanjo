Hi, my name is Michael. It's a pleasure to have you here

I am a data analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. I was exposed to Tableau, R programming and SQL used by Data Analyst during my learning stage and certification process. I was very proficient in the use of Excel before enrolling for the course.

I was awarded Google Data Analytics Certification through Coursera learning platform and currently aspiring to gain work experience and build a career in Data Analyst.
In this portfolio, I have included some of my projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find examples of dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Tableau and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.

In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data. I am confident that both technical skills acquired during my data analytics program and keen interest to problem solving skills made me an ideal candidate for junior data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you

Thank you for considering me as a candidate, I look forward to hearing from you soon. You can reach me by sending an email to adebanjomichael24@gmail.com
